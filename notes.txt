handiling events in react:

we dont manually select dom elemnts 

we use some thing to html inline event listeneres 

we will directly listen to events in element itself

onMouseEnter= {()=>{}} - not function call we need to specift function value because if we call it automatcally call when it gets rendered

we will create a seperate functiona and passs that function here 

----state

everything in React revolves around state 

what is state


why do we need

because upadting states triggers react to rerender the component 

persist local variabeles between renders 
states in practice : 

use State, useReducrer, contextApI, Redux 

Thnk about state: 

when we use state, where to place state, types of state

we dont updatedirect dom for manipulations

so we update
